Hi, I'm Fauxneme. Canadian immigrant to the US. Middle-aged, cis, white, (mostly) heterosexual guy. (Re)Married, with a 17yo and a 31yo. I've tried starting up a place to write online a few times now, and they've all fizzled. Hopefully I'll stick with this one. I figured doing the Github Pages-plus-Jekyll is lowest friction, and it'll just sit there if I fall away from it for a while.

For work I do AI-ish things for a Bay Area company (the cliches write themselves). My academic background is in cognitive science, by way of computer science and linguistics (both formal/theoreticalvand computational, along with a smattering of physics and philosophy. I also did a year of postdoctoral work looking at information theoretic approaches to some aspects of language.

(if you think you're able to ID me by what I've written here then there's a reasonable likelihood that we know each other...go ahead and hit me up at fauxnemic@gmail.com but I ask you to please keep the identity to yourself publicly)
