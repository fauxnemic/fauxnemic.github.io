Hi, I'm Fauxneme. Canadian immigrant to the US. Middle-aged, cis, white, (mostly) heterosexual guy. (Re)Married, with a 17yo and a 31yo.

For work I do AI-ish things for a Bay Area company (the cliches write themselves). I've tried starting up a place to write online a few times now, and they've all fizzled. Hopefully I'll stick with this one. I figured doing the Github Pages-plus-Jekyll is lowest friction, and it'll just sit there if I fall away from it for a while.

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
